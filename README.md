# Pigsty

Pigsty is designed as a replacement for Barnyard2.  It's written in Javascript
+ Node.js.

It's fast and modular, and designed to be easy to extend.  

## Why?

We wanted something that was a little more extensible than Barnyard2.  
Thus, Pigsty was born.

### But why javascript?!

Because it's hip and in!  But really, the node.js system is easy to develop
for and plus, it's performs pretty well. We've worked hard to make the mysql-output 
as optimized as possible on ACID schema.  

Don't believe us? Check out the benchmarks.
